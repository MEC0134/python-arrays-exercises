Different Use Cases
Python's lists are best suited to store data in the following situations: 

Several data types can be stored in lists, and their index can be used to access them.
Lists are good for mathematical operations on a group of elements because Python allows you to perform these operations directly on the list. 
If you don't know how many elements will be stored in your list ahead of time, it's easy to increase or decrease its size as needed.

Python's tuples are best suited to store data in the following situations: 

Itâ€™s best to use a tuple when you know the exact information that will go into the object's fields. 
For example, a tuple is okay for storing website credentials. 
The tuples are immutable (unchangeable), so they can only be used as keys for dictionaries. But if you want to use a list as a key, make it into a tuple first.

"""

# Using tuples as keys of dictionaries

tuplekey = {}

tuplekey[('blue', 'sky')] = 'Good'

tuplekey[('red','blood')] = 'Bad'

# print(tuplekey)


# Tuple Packing and Unpacking - Packing & unpacking improves code readability. Packing is assigning multiple values to tuple.
# Unpacking is assigning values to individual variables.

# Tuple Packing
person = ("Enes", "6 ft", "Employees")

# Tuple Un-packing
(name, height, profession) = person

print("The persons name from our tuple is:", name, "and he is", height)
